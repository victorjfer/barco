##Project description: 

[Barco a Vigo](http://barcoavigo.com/) is a beautiful app designed for android and ios. It allows the user to check public transit timetables between Vigo, the biggest city of Galicia (Spain), and the two most important towns in the area. For the development, I did not make any programming, I just use html5 code from [OnsenUI framework](https://onsen.io/guide/overview.html).

> The iOs version is no longer available, the Iphone market in Spain is low.

##Technical resume: 

Barco a Vigo app was builded with 2014 technology. Most of it in beta stated. This leads to two situations:

- Is the more time consuming app I never did. Now there are [other technologies](http://victorfernandez.me/apps/) that allows to create apps without programming, for other different purposes in a more simple way.
- The code is provably useless to anyone else than me. The new updated versions of the basic framework I use is no compatible with the updated one. However, you still can use it to see how I was able to build it without programing.

###THE BASE:

I made this app without programming. It makes use of [OnsenUI framework](https://onsen.io/guide/overview.html) (HTML5) to build and connect different pages.

The approach is really similar to the basic html pages I was told to build in the IT class in the school. The only difference is that I use the Onsen blocks instead normal html blocks. Therefore, I dinÂ´t have to worry about colors or any kind of CSS features.

Now the Onsen Ui framework used on the app has changed a lot. However, if you visit [this other framework](http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/) you will see something similar of what I had in 2014. I took the code that was useful for me, and I put in the right order. Later, I connected the different pages, so the user could change between pages by swiping with the finger or pressing a button. 


###Test and publishing: 

Even now I do not really know what is Phonegap or Cordova. What I do know is that if you upload the HTML5 app files to [Monaca](https://monaca.io/), you can easily [test](https://monaca.io/debugger.html) the result in your phone with their app.

In addition to that, once you consider that the app is perfect, you can graphically add the icons, put a name and version to the app. Finally you can generate a package to publish it on the app stores.

##Extra data: 

The code can be import as a monaca project for a deeper review. Just copy the github project link and paste it when you create a new monaca project.
